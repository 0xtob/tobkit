## Tobkit ##
.. is a (work-in-progress) library for creating user interfaces for [homebrew applications for the Nintendo DS](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nintendo_DS_homebrew).

It's meant to be (in this order)

  * **Easy to use (for users)**
  * **Aesthetically pleasant**
  * **Easy to use (for programmers)**


## Caution! ##

This is an open source rewrite of the original Tobkit. **It's not usable yet!**

## Wanna help? ##
